# Ape Escape Poptracker Changlelog

0.2.2

    Layouts -:

	    - [New] Map Tracker (Alternative) :
            - More of a vertical layout that occupy half a screen,so you can put your game/text client on the other half
        - Map Tracker : 
            - Added Total coins and Monkeys into "Map Tracker" layout
            - Changed Settings position to align (or try to) with Totals

    Autotracking -:

	    - Poptracker v0.27 : Implemented AddOnLocationSectionChangedHandler
            - Per Level Monkeys and Coins count tracking
            - Total Monkeys and Coins count tracking
	    - Changed location names for Dimension X coins (Both races)
        - Import settings from slot_data
            - As of the current release of the apeescape.apworld,this is not YET working. 
            - It is a work in progress but I will soon PR to the apworld to include it,
              so the tracker will be able to use it instantly when released

    Items/Locations -:

	    - Made Coins and Monkeys type "non-interractive" in the Layout
            - This change prevents user interaction while still allowing LocationSectionChangedHandler to update the Items int the layout (Per Level AND Totals)
            - Coins/Monkeys are always synced to map locations.
        - Changed World Keys initial quantity to 0
	    - Fixed Wrong coin totals for some levels  (WSW,TT and MM)
	    - Changed Total coins to 60 instead of 40
	    - Corrected wrong images for Monkey Total
	    - Split Dimension X coins into 5 distinct locations to better track them
	    - Fixed Cryptic Relics Monkeys images
	    - Changed fossil_field.json to fossil_fields.json to match real name of the location
	    - Corrected Wabi Sabi Wall and Crumbling Castle "code" not matching the Items in the grid properly
	    - Fixed Stadium Attack and Gladiator Attack access rules (Now requires respectivly 2 Keys and 4 Keys,in addition to existing rules)
	
    Logic -:
        - Dexter's Island: Corrected access rules for Frederick, Baba and Quirck

    Syntax errors & Misc-:
        - Deleted Duplicate statements in levels.json
